# Compositional Collection Views

This was created as a result of a weekend exploration of the new compositional collection views in iOS.

This is build from the Compositional Collection View chapter by Craig Clayton in the book Swift for Good by Paul Hudson and co. Absolutely recommended for anyone who wants to take their Swift/iOS skills to the next level.
